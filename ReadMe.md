## ATTENTION!

Never change files permissions in `/var/lib/clickhouse/backup`.
This path contains hard links. Permissions on all hard links to the same data on disk are always identical.
That means that if you change the permissions/owner/attributes on a hard link in backup path, permissions on files with which ClickHouse works will be changed too.
That might lead to data corruption.

## Examples

### Simple cron script for daily backup and uploading
```bash
#!/bin/bash
BACKUP_NAME=my_backup_$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H-%M-%S)
clickhouse-backup create $BACKUP_NAME
clickhouse-backup upload $BACKUP_NAME
```

### Ansible script for backup sharded cluster
You can use this playbook for daily backup of sharded cluster.
On the first day of month full backup will be uploaded and increment on the other days.
Use https://healthchecks.io for monitoring creating and uploading of backups.

```yaml
- hosts: clickhouse-cluster
  become: yes
  vars:
    healthchecksio_clickhouse_backup_id: "get on https://healthchecks.io"
    healthchecksio_clickhouse_upload_id: "..."
  roles:
    - clickhouse-backup
  tasks:
    - block:
        - uri: url="https://hc-ping.com/{{ healthchecksio_clickhouse_backup_id }}/start"
        - set_fact: backup_name="{{ lookup('pipe','date -u +%Y-%m-%d') }}-{{ clickhouse_shard }}"
        - set_fact: yesterday_backup_name="{{ lookup('pipe','date --date=yesterday -u +%Y-%m-%d') }}-{{ clickhouse_shard }}"
        - set_fact: current_day="{{ lookup('pipe','date -u +%d') }}"
        - name: create new backup
          shell: "clickhouse-backup create {{ backup_name }}"
          register: out
        - debug: var=out.stdout_lines
        - uri: url="https://hc-ping.com/{{ healthchecksio_clickhouse_backup_id }}"
      rescue:
        - uri: url="https://hc-ping.com/{{ healthchecksio_clickhouse_backup_id }}/fail"
    - block:
        - uri: url="https://hc-ping.com/{{ healthchecksio_clickhouse_upload_id }}/start"
        - name: upload full backup
          shell: "clickhouse-backup upload {{ backup_name }}"
          register: out
          when: current_day == '01'
        - name: upload diff backup
          shell: "clickhouse-backup upload {{ backup_name }} --diff-from {{ yesterday_backup_name }}"
          register: out
          when: current_day != '01'
        - debug: var=out.stdout_lines
        - uri: url="https://hc-ping.com/{{ healthchecksio_clickhouse_upload_id }}"
